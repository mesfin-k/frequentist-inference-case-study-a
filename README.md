# Frequentist Inference Case Study - Part A

This project explores core concepts in frequentist statistics, including confidence intervals and hypothesis testing. It was developed as part of Springboard's Data Science Career Track.

## 📘 Overview

Using simulated population data, we:

- Estimate population parameters from samples
- Calculate 95% confidence intervals using both z- and t-distributions
- Identify when it’s inappropriate to use the z-distribution
- Perform a one-sample t-test to determine statistical significance

## 🔍 Key Questions Answered

- **Q15**: Estimate population mean using a sample of size 50  
- **Q16**: Why using the z-distribution is incorrect when σ is unknown  
- **Q17**: Compute correct confidence interval using the t-distribution  
- **Q18**: Conduct a hypothesis test for whether the mean ≠ 172 cm
